**Objective:**

* The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to easily access weather information for any city.

**Functionality:**

* Users enter a city name in a search bar.
* Clicking the "Search" button triggers a weather lookup for the entered city.
* The application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, including current temperature, weather description, and an icon.
* It displays the retrieved information on the screen:
    * City name
    * Current temperature in Celsius (°C)
    * Weather description (e.g., cloudy, sunny)
    * Weather icon
* Additionally, the application fetches hourly forecasts for the next 24 hours (displayed in 3-hour intervals) and displays them in a scrollable section:
    * Time
    * Weather icon
    * Temperature in Celsius (°C)

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML: Defines the structure of the webpage, including the search bar, buttons, and weather information sections.
* CSS: Styles the visual elements of the application, including layout, background image, fonts, colours, and formatting.
* JavaScript: Provides interactivity, handling user input (search), fetching weather data from the API, and displaying the weather information and forecast.
* Bootstrap (optional): A CSS framework used for layout and pre-built components (like buttons).

**External APIs:**

* OpenWeatherMap API: Provides weather data for the specified location.

**Overall, this UrWeather application is a user-friendly weather information tool that leverages an external API to display current weather and hourly forecasts for a given city, fulfilling the objective of providing easy access to weather information.**
